### Hi there 👋

I'm a junior bioinfromatician from Robert Schneider's lab at Helmholtz Zentrum München. I mainly focus on bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data, especially on nascent RNA generated from metabolic labeling techniques. Overall very interested in using sequencing approaches to understand how RNA dynamics impact on different epigenetic processes.

Currently working on:

💻 Novel methods for identifying, quantifying and assessing differential usage of RNA-seq data composed of single and double nucleotide conversions for the study of RNA life.
🐍 *Snakemake* pipelines for reproducile analysis of RNA-seq data.
